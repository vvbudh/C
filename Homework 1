What I'm supposedly doing here.

/*
    structure that describes Triangle. It must contain sides - as integer values. It must contain Area of triangle. 

    

    You ask for input and fill two triangles - fill sides. 
        One function must be independent - and argument is triangle. 
            Declare function to fill sides INSIDE structure.
            Declare structure that contains two triangles as pointers to them
            Sum areas of this triangles.
            Inside triangle struct - function to calculate area of triangles.
